# Stiokit

Visual frontend IDE.

* **Visual constructor**: You can build interfaces the same way as it is implemented in many web-constructors, but with full power and expressiveness of CSS.
* **App structure based on graphs**: You can see and edit app relations in the same way you imagine them in your head.
* **Compiles into efficient framework code**: You don't need to be an expert in the frontend-framework, the vast majority of the code will be generated - you only need to write key parts of the logic or use modules written by other people. Any code from the NPM can be seamlessly integrated into your application. *(At the moment only React is supported)*
